# Leaf-Segmentation-and-Detection
The "Leaf Segmentation Using SegNet Model" project focuses on detecting leaf health through advanced image segmentation techniques. By leveraging the SegNet model, a sophisticated deep convolutional neural network, the project aims to isolate leaves from their backgrounds in various images, enabling detailed analysis. The SegNet 
architecture, which includes an encoder for feature extraction and a decoder for mapping features back to image dimensions, ensures precise segmentation. Post
segmentation, the health of the leaves is evaluated by examining characteristics such as color uniformity, texture smoothness, and shape regularity. This automated approach not only enhances accuracy but also offers a scalable solution for monitoring plant 
health, crucial for agriculture and horticulture industries. It employs the SegNet model, a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its 
effectiveness in pixel-wise segmentation. The SegNet architecture features an encoder that extracts image features and a decoder that reconstructs the segmented image,ensuring high precision. After segmentation, the project assesses leaf health by analyzing various features such as color, texture, and shape. Healthy leaves typically exhibit a uniform green color, smooth texture, and regular shape. In contrast, unhealthy leaves may show discoloration, spots, or irregular edges, indicative of disease or nutrient deficiencies. This method not only improves the accuracy of health detection but also offers a scalable and automated solution for plant health monitoring, benefiting agricultural and horticultural practices.
